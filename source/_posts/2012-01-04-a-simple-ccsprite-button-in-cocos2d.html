CCSprite's can implement the <code>&lt;CCTargetedTouchDelegate&gt;</code> protocol and implement the <code>ccTouchBegan:</code>, <code>ccTouchEnded:</code>, <code>ccTouchMoved:</code> and <code>ccTouchCancelled:</code> methods. I've built a class called <code>GTButton</code> that does this and allows you to specify two sprites to toggle between when the touch occurs. By default you must release your finger in the CCSprite to run a selector (a method on a target object), but you can change this with <code>mustRelease</code and <code>mustReleaseInside</code> boolean properties of the <code>GTButton</code> object. Here's the header file and the download link to the sample project. Remember to change the target SDK in the project settings to the latest one on your Xcode install - I used 5.0.

<pre class="lang:objc " >
#import "cocos2d.h"

typedef enum buttonState {
	FMButtonSelected, // Finger Down
	FMButtonUnselected // Finger Up
} FMButtonState;

@interface GTButton : CCSprite <CCTargetedTouchDelegate> {
	FMButtonState state;
	CCSprite *spriteSelected, *spriteUnselected;
	id target;
	SEL selector;
	/*
	 mustRelease means you must lift your finger anywhere on screen to perform the selector.
	 mustReleaseInside is subset of mustRelease and means you must lift your finger inside sprite.
	 */
	BOOL mustRelease, mustReleaseInside;
}

@property (assign,readwrite,nonatomic) id target;
@property (assign,readwrite,nonatomic) SEL selector;
@property (assign,readwrite,nonatomic) BOOL mustReleaseInside, mustRelease;

+(GTButton*) buttonWithUnselectedSprite:(CCSprite*)theSpriteUnselected SelectedSprite:(CCSprite*)theSpriteSelected Target:(id)theTarget Selector:(SEL)theSelector;
-(id) initWithUnselectedSprite:(CCSprite*)theSpriteUnselected SelectedSprite:(CCSprite*)theSpriteSelected Target:(id)theTarget Selector:(SEL)theSelector;
-(void) setTextureFromSprite:(CCSprite*)sprite;
-(void) setSelected:(BOOL)selected;
-(BOOL) containsTouchLocation:(UITouch *)touch;
// Rect relative to the anchorPoint
-(CGRect) relRect;

@end
