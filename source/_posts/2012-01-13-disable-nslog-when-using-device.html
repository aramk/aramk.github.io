If you're testing a game on a device, it's good to disable NSLogs, since you're not going to read them unless you've got it plugged into Xcode and viewing the debugger. I usually test on the device once I'm satisfied it works in the Simulator.

<pre class="lang:c " >
#if !defined(DEBUG) || !(TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR)
    #define NSLog(...)
#endif
</pre>

If you still want to have the NSLogs on the device:

<pre class="lang:c " >
#ifndef(DEBUG)
    #define NSLog(...)
#endif
</pre>
