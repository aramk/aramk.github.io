title: Hello Jekyll, Goodbye Wordpress
---

So my Wordpress site got hacked rather badly recently and 000webhost canceled my free hosting:

![Site Down](/assets/img/2013/05/site-down.png)

Realising the amount of effort I put into writing templates, uploading huge amounts of files and using crappy FTP connections, I looked for a better way to post stuff.

Jekyll is a static website generator written in Ruby, is very light and didn't take nearly as much time to install, even though I had to set up DNS records again.

1. Take a look at the [source branch](https://github.com/aramkocharyan/aramkocharyan.github.io/tree/source) of this website.

2. Fork the repo and checkout both the `source` and `master` branches.

3. Make some changes to the site in the `source` branch and push them.

4. Run [publish.sh](https://github.com/aramkocharyan/aramkocharyan.github.io/blob/source/publish.sh), which will build the site in the `master` branch and push it.

If you're hosting a **Project Page** instead of a **User Page**, you need to push to a `gh-pages` branch instead, so edit `publish.sh` to your needs. See the [GitHub Pages guide](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages).

This has some setbacks - even though I installed the Wordpress importer like so:

	sudo gem install jekyll-import --pre

And followed their [importing guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations), my old posts are more or less broken. But I think cleaning them up will be a more long term solution, and I don't need a PHP server anymore :)

I plan to port [Crayon](https://github.com/aramkocharyan/crayon-syntax-highlighter) eventually, but that's another story.
