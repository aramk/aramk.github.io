I've added bbPress support into Crayon since <a href="https://github.com/aramkocharyan/crayon-syntax-highlighter/commit/6f204aaa6d3c3ef1fc90512cc362f5562b91527b" target="_blank">1.11</a>.Â Make sure you enable the setting <strong>"Display the Tag Editor in any TinyMCE instances on the frontend"</strong>, which is off by default from v1.15 to reduce the number of needed resources. This is needed to display the Tag Editor for any other <strong>frontend</strong> TinyMCE editors you may have (including but not limited to those in bbPress).

I'd appreciate any bug testing (and fixing?!) from people who use bbPress, since I've made a lot of changes to the Tag Editor javascript in this beta hopefully everything works as smoothly.
