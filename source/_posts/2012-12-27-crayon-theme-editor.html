The Theme Editor allows you to duplicate and modify custom themes compatible with Crayon using an integrated user interface and <em>no CSS knowledge</em> whatsoever. Of course, make changes to your theme by editing the CSS is also possible before and after using the theme editor.

You can access the theme editor in Wordpress admin under <strong>Settings &gt; Crayon</strong>:

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2013-01-02-at-1.44.40-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1138" title="Screen Shot 2013-01-02 at 1.44.40 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2013-01-02-at-1.44.40-AM.png" alt="" width="756" height="236" /></a>

The Theme section displays the information about the current theme, a toolbar for performing theme editor actions and the Live Preview. Modifying any settings automatically refreshes this preview before submitting the settings page.
<h2>Theme Types</h2>
Crayon stores the <strong>Stock Themes</strong> which come with the plugin under this path:

<code>wp-content/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/themes</code>

To allow modifying these themes and preserving changes, Crayon stores <strong>User Themes</strong> under this path:

<code>wp-content/uploads/crayon-syntax-highlighter/themes</code>

This avoids any changes being overwritten during updates to the plugin. Stock themes can't be deleted or modified for this reason - unless you enable <code>CRAYON_DEBUG</code> in <code>globals.php</code>. Of course, modifying the theme CSS is independent of the Theme Editor, but keep in mind that your changes will be lost when updating the plugin.
<h2>Creating Themes</h2>
Start by selecting an existing theme which is the closest appearance you're trying to create. To play it safe, start with the Classic theme. Click Duplicate and type in a new name.

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-12.54.10-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1110" title="Screen Shot 2012-12-30 at 12.54.10 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-12.54.10-AM.png" alt="" width="280" height="160" /></a>

The theme is duplicated as a User Theme. Now click Edit to load the Theme Editor.

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.01.26-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1112" title="Screen Shot 2012-12-30 at 1.01.26 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.01.26-AM.png" alt="" width="785" height="339" /></a>

One handy feature of the editor is that modifications take place live just like in the regular settings page - so changing the language or settings will also change them in the theme editor, allowing you to see how your changes will look like for different settings.

On the right side you'll see the editor controls. The first tab allows you to change information about the theme. Saving the theme is possible at any time and doesn't require a reload unless you change the name of the theme. You can also look at the CSS with a link below the name.

Next, I might want to change the appearance of the frame and line colours.

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.06.39-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1113" title="Screen Shot 2012-12-30 at 1.06.39 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.06.39-AM.png" alt="" width="781" height="288" /></a>

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.07.43-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1114" title="Screen Shot 2012-12-30 at 1.07.43 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.07.43-AM.png" alt="" width="779" height="375" /></a>

Next, I can change the line numbers.

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.19.57-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1115" title="Screen Shot 2012-12-30 at 1.19.57 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.19.57-AM.png" alt="" width="777" height="549" /></a>

And then the toolbar.

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.55.15-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1116" title="Screen Shot 2012-12-30 at 1.55.15 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-1.55.15-AM.png" alt="" width="780" height="409" /></a>

Finally, we can take a look at the highlighting! I've left this till last since I wanted to make sure I have the overall look of the new theme first.

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-2.03.45-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1118" title="Screen Shot 2012-12-30 at 2.03.45 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-30-at-2.03.45-AM.png" alt="" width="778" height="750" /></a>

And there we have it, a new theme! Tinker with the settings until you have the right look. This theme is obviously a 5 minute demonstration and the some of the stock themes that people have put together look amazing comparatively - but the important thing to take away from this post is that creating themes is now super quick and very much integrated into Crayon!
<h2>Submitting a Theme</h2>
Remember, if you happen to create a theme you're especially proud of, please use the <strong>Submit</strong> button - it will zip up your theme and email it to me and I'll include it as a Stock Theme for others to enjoy!
