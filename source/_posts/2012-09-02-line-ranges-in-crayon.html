Due to a recent request I've added a feature in Crayon that allows you to specify a line range (e.g. 3-5) of code to include in the Crayon. Only the lines in this range are actually used in the output.

Here's the original:

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-02-at-3.09.37-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-987" title="Screen Shot 2012-09-02 at 3.09.37 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-02-at-3.09.37-AM.png" alt="" width="652" height="161" /></a>

And with a range:

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-02-at-3.09.50-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-988" title="Screen Shot 2012-09-02 at 3.09.50 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-02-at-3.09.50-AM.png" alt="" width="698" height="244" /></a>

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-02-at-3.10.09-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-989" title="Screen Shot 2012-09-02 at 3.10.09 AM" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screen-Shot-2012-09-02-at-3.10.09-AM.png" alt="" width="649" height="57" /></a>

You can also provide the range as a single number and only show one line in the output. This will be released with Crayon 1.10.2, but it's available now at <a href="https://github.com/aramkocharyan/crayon-syntax-highlighter/">GitHub</a>.
