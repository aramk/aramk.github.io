Last semester we made a Java game using the Slick library for our project called Shadow Wing. I've packaged the game in a single zip, all you need is to have the <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/" target="_blank">Java Runtime Environment</a> installed on your computer and then run the .exe inside the zip. If you're on a Mac or Linux machine, you can run the .jar as long as you set the max memory heap to something like 128MB, otherwise the game dies after it fills the available memory. This wasn't a problem on my Mac, but I had to make custom exe's for Windows because the default memory heap was lower. In case the game doesn't start you can always set your heap larger (say min 32 to max 128MB) with:

<div class="centered bold code">java -Xms32m -Xmx128m -jar shadow_wing.jar</div>

<div class="centered wrap">
<div class="centered-button"><a class="ak-button" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?9z4z6gadtwhido1">Download Shadow Wing</a></div>
<div class="centered-button"><a class="ak-button" href="http://www.mediafire.com/?bh0av93peafiwoq">Download Source Code</a></div>
</div>
