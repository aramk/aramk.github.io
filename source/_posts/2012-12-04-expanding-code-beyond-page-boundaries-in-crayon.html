In <a href="http://github.com/aramkocharyan/crayon-syntax-highlighter/" target="_blank">1.16</a>Â I've added the ability to expand the code beyond the page border by setting it as large as it needs to be to accomodate the code within. Enable the setting "Expand code beyond page borders on mouseover" under Settings &gt; Crayon &gt; Code, which is disabled by default.

I've also added a new toggle which expands and contracts.
