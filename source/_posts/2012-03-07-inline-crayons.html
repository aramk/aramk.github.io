<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Use the <a href="http://localsite.com/ak/projects/crayon-tag-editor/">Tag Editor</a> for creating inline tags. The approach below is now depreciated.

<hr />

As of Crayon 1.8.3, you can have inline Crayons floating in the middle of sentences for quick snippets. You can use them like you'd use <code style="font-style: inherit;">code</code> tags.

<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-07-at-12.18.53-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839" title="" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-07-at-12.18.53-PM.png" alt="" width="505" height="25" /></a>

Here's the code in the editor:
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true crayon-plain-tag">Here's an example of a floating {php} echo 'Crayon'; {/php} right in the middle of a sentence. Neat!</pre>
They work like <a title="Mini Tags And Plain Tags In Crayon" href="http://localsite.com/ak/projects/mini-tags-in-crayon/">Mini Tags</a> which use square brackets but instead Inline Tags use curly brackets. You can also use them like <code>[php inline="true"]...[/php]</code> or <code>$[crayon lang="xml" inline="true"]...[/crayon]</code> as well.

Also, I've added a new feature to make `backquotes` into <code>code</code>. Easy!

Oh, and one more thing - you can have Crayons (both normal and inline) in comments :)

You can <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/33811812/Crayon/crayon-syntax-highlighter-1.8.3-beta.zip" target="_blank">download</a> the beta release now.

All these tag settings are now in their own section in Settings &gt; Crayon.
