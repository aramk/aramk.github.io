Last semester we did a project with <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a> where we need to design an educational game to test out the Uni's new MUGLE online game engine. My team's was called "Mechanix":
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mugle-app.appspot.com/+games/p-robot/Mechanix/" target="_blank">http://mugle-app.appspot.com/+<wbr>games/p-robot/Mechanix/</wbr></a></p>
<a href="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-15-at-1.16.11-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-545" title="" src="http://localsite.com/ak/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Screen-Shot-2011-09-15-at-1.16.11-AM-300x224.png" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>

While the educational value of the game has little merit, I think a lot of the work was put into a decent physics engine which was fun to make.
